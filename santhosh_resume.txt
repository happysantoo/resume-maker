Cloud-Native Funds Control Platform: Provided Principal architectural leadership for a cloud-neutral, multi-region resilient funds control platform, resulting in 30% reduced inter-region latency and establishing a new 99.99% availability standard.
Mainframe Modernization Initiative: Led the strategic modernization of mainframe-hosted legacy payment systems to modern cloud-native architecture. Architected and executed the incremental migration of COBOL-based batch processing systems to containerized Spring Boot microservices on AWS, resulting in 70% reduction in processing time and enabling real-time transaction capabilities. Implemented dual-run validation strategies to ensure zero data loss during the transition.
Legacy System Modernization: Defined and drove the technical roadmap for core legacy system migration, orchestrating the transition from monolith to microservices, which enabled 60% faster feature release cycles and reduced technical debt by 80%.
FinOps and Automation: Championed Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices (Terraform/CloudFormation) and FinOps principles, optimizing cloud resource consumption to achieve 30% reduction in infrastructure costs.
Enterprise Security Governance: Drove the adoption of standardized security frameworks across 15+ applications, leveraging the proprietary file encryption system to mitigate PII exposure and ensure SAX audit compliance.
Observability: Integrated enterprise observability solutions using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana to reduce mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) and cut production incidents by 45%.
